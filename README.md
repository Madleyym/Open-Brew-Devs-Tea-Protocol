## 🧪 Testnet Information

Open Brew is currently running on TEA Protocol's testnet environment. This means:

- All transactions are performed on the testnet blockchain
- Test tokens are used instead of real cryptocurrency
- Features and functionalities are being tested before mainnet launch
- Data may be reset during testing phases

To interact with Open Brew on the testnet:
1. Connect using a testnet-compatible wallet
2. Request test tokens from the [TEA Protocol faucet](https://faucet-sepolia.tea.xyz/#/) (or appropriate link)
3. Provide feedback on any issues or bugs you encounter

The testnet version allows users to experience the full functionality of Open Brew without financial risk while we continue to optimize and improve the platform before our mainnet release.
